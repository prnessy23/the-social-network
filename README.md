#### The Social Network
_________________________________________
This is an example of an API for a social network that uses a MongoDB database to allow for large amounts of unstructured data.
It also uses Express.js for routing, Mongoose ODM and the Day.js package to format time stamps.

##### Acceptance Criteria
- When entering the command to invoke the application, the server is started and the Mongoose models are synced with the MongoDB database.

- Testing API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts returns the data for each of these routes in formatted JSON.
- Testing API POST, PUT and DELETE routes in Insomnia will be able to create, update and delete users and thoughts.
